/* ActionPredict -- predict the net benefit of taking an action
 *
 * This formula is tied in to what the AMC pool class does, i.e.
 * a copying collection.
 *
 * In equilibrium, with a steady heap size, reclaim rate is equal
 * to the allocation rate of the mutator.
 *
 * In practice, the mutator will want to control the reclaim rate
 * by making it a function of the amount of memory
 * used and the amount of memory available -- zero at zero used, and
 * infinity when all memory is used, such that the collector tries to
 * balance with the mutator somewhere in-between.
 *
 * The RECLAIM_BENEFIT is the amount the mutator is willing to pay
 * to manage each byte it allocates (in the same units as the COSTs).
 *
 * How do we think about pause times?
 *
 * Could do with a factor for the temporary space cost of copying collection.
 * What about memory touching costs and swap costs?  What about number of faults?
 * What about the balance between ambiguous and exact references?
 *
 * Perhaps these figures should be determined empirically.

 * .def.ref: Ref is an alias for Addr which can be used to document
 * where references are being passed.
 *
 * .def.refset: RefSet is a conservative approximation to a set of
 * references.  It is conservative in the sense that if isMember returns
 * FALSE for a reference then it is guaranteed that the reference was
 * not added into the RefSet (i.e., accumulating a pointer guarantees
 * that isMember will return TRUE for that reference), but the converse
 * is not true (i.e., isMember can return TRUE for references that have
 * not been accumulated).
 *
 * RefSets are designed to provide a very fast method for Add and
 * for IsMember.  Add is used to implement reference summaries,
 * which provide a remembered set.  IsMember is used to inline part
 * of the Fix function, and provide good discrimination of the
 * white set.  It is expected that the discrimination provided
 * will be useful for distinguishing segments and groups of segments.
 *
 * .def.objset: ObjSets are a parallel concept to RefSets and give
 * a conservative approximation to a set of objects.  It is conservative
 * in the sense that if isMember returns FALSE for an object, then it is
 * guarantees that the object is not in the set.
 *
 * For a set of objects, another object may have a reference to the set
 * if its reference set intersects with the object set.
